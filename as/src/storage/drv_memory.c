/* SYNOPSIS
 * In-memory storage driver
 *
 * This code almost entirely performs no-ops, because all the in-memory state
 * is correct already.
 * Note that this code is mostly for the NON-PERSISTENT main memory namespace.
 * The File-backed (persistent) main memory namespace is NOT type 1 (MM) for
 * some calls, but is instead treated as type 2 (SSD);  hence in some cases
 * the SSD functions, like as_storage_bin_can_fit(), are applied with an SSD
 * context rather than a transient main memory context.  (tjl)
