/*
 * Large Data Type (LDT)
 *
 * The General LDT value comprises a "Top Record" (a regular Aerospike record)
 * which contains a bin that is a Large Data Type.  In that LDT Bin there is
 * a map that contains pointers to some number of "Sub Records" (aka. "Chunks",
 * aka "child records", that are linked to the Top Rec).
 * Currently we limit the number of open sub (esr + subrec) to 20, but this
 * will change as the LDT structures get more sophisticated.  Over time, we'll
 * likely manage the open structures dynamically and thus allow large numbers
 * of open subs, should the situation require it.
